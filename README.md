# "The One Question Interview"

âœ… [Check out Dave Gray's YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

**Description:**

I Have Only One Javascript Question... It is hard to imagine, but a Reddit post reported a job interview with only one Javascript question. In this Javascript tutorial, we'll answer that question and break down the logic behind the answer. 

[YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Jm4TbtO8-ko) for this repository.

I suggest completing Dave Gray's [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk) if you are new to Javascript.

**My Modifications:**
1. Use `(n, k)` variable to match ones from Wikipedia
1. Start with none empty array const `stackArray = [ [1] ]`;
1. Remove the if statement to set first/last cell value, we would rather calculate their values (the Nullish coalescing operator comes in handy here)
1. Collapse the borders of consecutive squares
1. Adding `odd` class on squares with odd values to make the pascal's triangle pattern standout a little bit.
